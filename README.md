=======================

a static website
https://dieseltravis.github.io/

I wanted a simple repository for various images, so I forked of [jayanta525/github-pages-directory-listing](https://github.com/jayanta525/github-pages-directory-listing) and made the HTML/CSS much cruder, with just some basic javascript sorting. The icons were based on windows 98 and some were just tweaked slightly. Then I also added options to generate RSS and Atom feeds for each listing:
[dieseltravis/github-pages-directory-listing/tree/dieseltravis-html](https://github.com/dieseltravis/github-pages-directory-listing/tree/dieseltravis-html)

I just use symlinking of files into categories in sub-folders:
```
ln -s ../rear-admiral.gif ./gifs/simpsons/
```
