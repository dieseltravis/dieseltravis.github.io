Here&#x27;s some notable data from the RubberMag article:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Performance Data&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acceleration - 0 ­ 20 mph in 4.3s (32kph), 0 ­ 30 mph in 7.3s (48 kph), 0 ­ 50 mph in 12.1s (80kph)Top speed - 50 mph (80kph) (note: ENV has been tested to 50mph ­ however, with further refinements and redevelopments, this top speed is expected to be exceeded)Range - At least 100 miles (160km)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bike mass - 80 kg (Total mass including CORE) &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?q=80+kg+in+lbs&quot;&gt;note: about 176 lbs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So it&#x27;s no rocket hitting it&#x27;s top speed of 50mph in 12.1 seconds, but it&#x27;s a start. It is silent and emissions free, which are probably the biggest problems with current gasoline-powered motorcycles. There is no mention of price, or the price of whatever device you&#x27;ll need to produce the Hydrogen at home, so don&#x27;t get your hopes up just yet. For it to succeed I think it&#x27;ll need to hit 80mph (in 12 seconds), have at least double the range, cost less than $10K USD, and be manufactured by a reputable company like Honda. The first two should be easy because of the bike&#x27;s light weight, the other two will probably be very difficult though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.rubbermag.com/news/imgs/050315_env.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Intelligent Energy - ENV&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.intelligent-energy.com/images/uploads/env_brochure.pdf&quot; title=&quot;ENV and Core  PDF&quot;&gt;Intelligent Energy has a PDF on their site with more info&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","enclosures":[],"source":{"url":"","title":""},"changefreq":"never","priority":"0.1","bodyArticleHtml":"<hgroup><h3><time datetime=\"2005-03-21T11:55:00.000Z\" pubdate=\"pubdate\">2005-03-21</time></h3><h1><a href=\"http://travis.servebeer.com/posts/2005/03/21/fuel-cell-moto\">Fuel-cell Moto</a></h1><h2></h2></hgroup><p><a href="http:</p><blockquote><p>PerformanceData</p><p>Acceleration-0­20mphin4.3s(32kph),0­30mphin7.3s(48kph),0­50mphin12.1s(80kph)Topspeed-50mph(80kph)(note:ENVhasbeentestedto50mph­however,withfurtherrefinementsandredevelopments,thistopspeedisexpectedtobeexceeded)Range-Atleast100miles(160km)</p><p>Physical</p><p>Bikemass-80kg(TotalmassincludingCORE)<em><ahref="http://www.google.com/search?q=80+kg+in+lbs">note:about176lbs</a></em></p></blockquote><p>Soit'snorockethittingit'stopspeedof50mphin12.1seconds,butit'sastart.Itissilentandemissionsfree,whichareprobablythebiggestproblemswithcurrentgasoline-poweredmotorcycles.Thereisnomentionofprice,orthepriceofwhateverdeviceyou'llneedtoproducetheHydrogenathome,sodon'tgetyourhopesupjustyet.ForittosucceedIthinkit'llneedtohit80mph(in12seconds),haveatleastdoubletherange,costlessthan$10KUSD,andbemanufacturedbyareputablecompanylikeHonda.Thefirsttwoshouldbeeasybecauseofthebike'slightweight,theothertwowillprobablybeverydifficultthough.</p><p><imgsrc="http://www.rubbermag.com/news/imgs/050315_env.jpg"alt="Intelligent Energy - ENV"/></p><p><ahref="http://www.intelligent-energy.com/images/uploads/env_brochure.pdf"title="ENV and Core  PDF">IntelligentEnergyhasaPDFontheirsitewithmoreinfo</a></p>",	"bodyNavItems": [								{									"pageRel": "prev",								"href": "/posts/2005/04/12/it-starts-with-a-fruit-fly",				"text": "Itstartswithafruitfly"			}					, 			{									"pageRel": "prev",								"href": "/posts/2005/03/22/do-i-need-a-jacket",				"text": "DoINeedaJacket?"			}					, 			{									"pageRel": "self",								"href": "/posts/2005/03/21/fuel-cell-moto",				"text": "Fuel-cellMoto"			}					, 			{									"pageRel": "next",								"href": "/posts/2005/03/21/how-to-be-a-camwhore",				"text": "HowtobeaCamWhore"			}					, 			{								"href": "/posts/2005/03/10/it-figures",				"text": "Itfigures..."			}			]}
