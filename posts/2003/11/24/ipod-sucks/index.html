Honestly, this page is just a place where 12 year olds come to bitch about how the other 12 year olds suck and how they are wrong, while everyone fails to listen to anyone else. No, this forum isn't about calling people fags, it's about how much iPod sucks. Yeah, they do. They have alot of accessories and peripherals though, made just for the type of people that think beauty is only on the outside. They only want pretty things, which is basically Mac's concept. They impress the consumer with vivid flowing shapes, portability, and simplicity, but their products fail to perform correctly. No electronic is perfect, I agree with Andy. But the iPod dazzles everyone with its small size, which tends to squish the electronics like the Tokyoan subway system. Nothing can work in cramped conditions, so it just breaks. It's a problem, but everyone seems to want the smallness. I own a Zen Touch 20gb, which I have had absolutely no problems with since the day I took it out of its box. I studied deep into the specifications of basically every Mp3 player, and after hours of searching, I found this to be the best. It has simply, the best battery life AND stereo quality sounds, comes with everything you need to play it right away, it even has fifty pre-loaded songs on it. I have never owned an iPod, but I have a friend who does. The thing scratches every fifteen seconds, which takes the ecstasy out of getting it brand new. If you ask me, the iPod is just ugly to look at, it's too simple. The only thing it has is customizability.</td></tr><tr><td>Stop Your Bitching </td><td><time datetime="2004-12-30T00:36:00.000Z" pubdate="pubdate">2004-12-29 07:36</time></td><td>All I hear these days are, the fagots just like you complaining about a decent product you probably can't even afford, or your just one of those fagots that like to boycott large corporations.<br/><br/>So Just Fuck Off</td></tr><tr><td>Stop Your Bitching </td><td><time datetime="2004-12-30T15:34:00.000Z" pubdate="pubdate">2004-12-30 10:34</time></td><td>Don't mind my previous, opinion.

Apple is quite good at marketing and gimmicks, so much so that the iPod has turned many users into cult fanatics. I am perplexed as to why iPod owners would love their iPods so much, when iPods are actually sub-par in audio quality, battery life and durability.<br/><br/>Numbers do not lie, but these numbers simply show that the advertisement-saturated populace will buy anything, so long as it is thrown in their faces long enough. Advertising is very effective, as Apple has illustrated for us with its iPod.<br/><br/>When I was in the market for an MP3 player, I was originally going to purchase a 60 gig iPod photo. I had the money, but I didn't think the price tag made sense.<br/><br/>After doing a lot of research, I ended up with a Creative Labs Zen Xtra 30gig. I paid far less, I can replace my own battery without risking damage to the player, and the sound quality is amazing.<br/><br/>My Xtra does not look anything like the iPod, but it is smaller than the CD player I had been using, saves me the hassle of toting around a binder of CDs, constantly provides me with 11 hours of battery life per charge, and does what it is supposed to do. I have some minor complaints about navigating through my music, but I can deal with it.</td></tr><tr><td>zhang </td><td><time datetime="2005-01-06T19:52:00.000Z" pubdate="pubdate">2005-01-06 02:52</time></td><td>The only reason iPOD is so popular is that they have good advertisement. They have the skills to turn a (in my opinion) bad product into a moneymaker. The iPOD has:<br/><br/>1. Poor sound quality<br/>2. About 18-24 month battery that is replaceable by a $99 dollar charge.<br/>3. Very high price tags<br/><br/>Also, the iPOD was the first hard-disk mp3 introduced on the market, which is another reason it has become so famous. However, in about 2-3 years, the numbers will drop after iPOD users realize that their battery will only work for one hour.<br/><br/>Personally, I advise you to buy a Dell Pocket DJ, if you don't need so much space for music. It's comes with a very pretty price tag (only $199) with a 1-year warranty and 5 GB of space, whereas the iPOD mini comes with 4 GB of space and costs $249 more!</td></tr><tr><td>Stanley Angelo </td><td><time datetime="2005-01-07T10:38:00.000Z" pubdate="pubdate">2005-01-07 05:38</time></td><td>"1. Poor sound quality"<br/><br/>Not really. As a confirmed audiophile, I find that all of the MP3 players (dell dj, iPod, etc) perform consistently well. As long as the source files are of high quality (.mp3 &gt;=192kbps) I don't notice much of a difference. The only problem I have found is with some cheaper players the backlight causes a very high-pitched noise. Only 5-10% of the population can hear noises in this range so it's not even a big deal for most people.<br/><br/>"2. About 18-24 month battery that<br/>is replaceable by a $99 dollar charge."<br/><br/>Not really. I have a number of music players, and the iPod seems about average for battery life. Lithium-ion batteries have natural likes and dislikes. It is not good to leave them fully charged for too long, and it is not good to fully discharge them. It's better to use them and then recharge them at regular intervals, and keep them from getting too hot or too cold. EVERY music player that uses a lithium-ion battery will have the same problems, including iRiver and Dell DJ. Also, the iPod battery is fairly easy to replace. Apple doesn't want to admit it, but you can just pop off the back with a screwdriver and replace it with a $40 knockoff.<br/><br/>"3. Very high price tags"<br/><br/>Guilty as charged. Apple products routinely cost more than their counterparts, and physically they are of similar quality to their competition. In the past, the design was light-years ahead of the others, but some newer players have equally good interfaces now.<br/><br/>Perhaps the extra $80 or so is a back-breaker for someone scrimping and saving. But then I see those same people who complain buy a set of $200 rims for their car or who subscribe to some overpriced ISP like AOL I just shake my head. It all depends what you want to spend your money on.</td></tr><tr><td>I dont think so </td><td><time datetime="2005-01-07T21:25:00.000Z" pubdate="pubdate">2005-01-07 04:25</time></td><td>Typcial biased comments from a Mac fanatic. Don't try to jump on the bandwagon supplying that "what I say goes" attitude. No one could care less what your personal experience have lead you to belive. People refer to mass statistics not personal opinion. Taking these statistics into consideration, the Apple IPod indeed comes up short in both ability to support high audio quality and maintaining a dependable battery life. Furthermore, "popping" off the back of your Ipod and replacing it with your own battery....that's all fine and dandy if your willing to void your warranty with Apple....and don't try to contradict me cause it has already been done and Apple most definately voids your warranty if you try to replace the battery yourself.</td></tr><tr><td>I dont think so </td><td><time datetime="2005-01-07T21:29:00.000Z" pubdate="pubdate">2005-01-07 04:29</time></td><td>I also have to say that it's pretty sad to keep seeing people say that other people who won't pay the price tag on an Ipod only won't pay cause they can't afford it.

If they decided to bottle air and sell it, calling it, no doubt, "PowerAir" or "AirMac" or "AirPod," they'd claim that they had invented air. Then all the articles about the new MacAir would treat that claim as if it were true and suddenly start treating other air-packagers as mere imitators, playing "catch-up" with Apple.<br/><br/>I remember years ago, when Apple came out with their PowerBook notebook computer. I was at a meeting with an extraordinarily dumb young movie producer who kept going on and on about all the cool things his PowerBook could do. "It can sign on the internet and get email! I can care it with me on planes and it runs on batteries!"<br/><br/>Finally I got fed up and just showed him my Toshiba laptop. "I can do all those things, and this computer cost me a thousand dollars less than yours."<br/><br/>It was a cruel thing to do, I thought, to take the wind out of his sails like that. But no, I had forgotten: He was an Apple user! He gave me a withering look and said, "Yes, but mine is an Apple."<br/><br/>Well, yes, but he said it as if that were a good thing.<br/><br/>Think about it. All the rigid, corporate-determined uniformity and buy-it-from-us-or-drop-dead attitude of Microsoft, but you have to buy your hardware from them, too. I watch Apple users attempt to manipulate their clunky operating system -- click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, just to get where I can go with a single action on my keyboard -- and I hear them raving on and on about what wonderful trhings Apple is finally deigning to make available to them, but which PC users have had for years, and it all makes me vaguely sad.<br/><br/>"Windows crashes all the time," they say with a smirk. Then, when they're talking among themselves and they don't think you're listening, they reveal the evil truth: Macs crash too. And Mac software has bugs and flaws and security gaps and stupidity built in, just like Windows.<br/><br/>What Macs don't have is any competition. Once you've bought into the hype and forked over your money, they've got you and you can't get free without completely replacing everything.<br/><br/>The same thing has happened now with the iPod. I had been using wonderful MP3 players for years. My Rio Riot held twenty gigs of music. My little Panasonic E-Wear, and later my Rio Cali, let me take incredible amounts of music with me when I exercised or took long flights.<br/><br/>Then the iPod comes out and it doesn't do anything that I needed and didn't already have. Not only that, but it was deeply ugly, a plain ivory-colored box with pathetic controls that looked like it should hold generic earswabs. Compared to my Rio Riot, it was a piece of junk and looked like a piece of junk.<br/><br/>And now it seems to have taken over the world. Everything is geared toward iPods. I still have MP3 players with more capacity and better interface than the iPod, and people talk and write as if the iPod had invented the whole class of machine, and all the others were just imitations.<br/><br/>Even the current PC World magazine has been suckered into this Apple mystique. They had a "brave and daring" front-of-book essay about how PC makers ought to learn to do things more like Apple. And do you know what it came down to? The colors and shape of the cheap plastic they wrap their products in.<br/><br/>Yeah, that's right. They make the ugliest, silliest, most embarrassing-looking cheap plastic products in the industry, charge half again as much as you'd pay for a cleanly designed, functional looking product, and they are given credit for design!<br/><br/>I know what will happen, of course. A lot of smug Apple owners will write me taunting letters about how Windows crashes all the time. Old news, kiddies. My XP doesn't crash at all. And I have about a hundred times as much software to choose from, and can customize my own machine (despite the best efforts of Microsoft) a thousand times more than you can, and I'm paying less for it, and it looks like I actually intend to do serious work with it.<br/><br/>As for your iPod, I just have to shake my head and laugh. There are much better -- and better-looking -- products out there, and I already own some of them. But you go on believing that yours Is the best in the world. That's what Apple depends on. You'll get into the harness, they'll put the blinders on you, and you'll think you're pulling the queen's carriage instead of the old farm wagon you're dragging along.
