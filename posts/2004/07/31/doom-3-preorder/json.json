You only have to pay $10 right now, and you get this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?id=1067389449015&amp;skuId=6174132&amp;type=product&quot;&gt;little bonus pack&lt;/a&gt; with a little pewter mancubus figurine, a poster, a coupon for $5 off any RTCW game for the PC, and a $10 coupon for an nVidia FX5700 or FX 5900.  Then on the release date you just show up with your receipt and they&#x27;ll take the $10 you&#x27;ve already paid off of the final price.  I&#x27;ve never preordered a game before but it makes sense to do it that way.  In fact I&#x27;m pretty sure that the last game I&#x27;ve bought for the PC was Doom 2 (I&#x27;m not 100% positive, but I haven&#x27;t been able to think of another game that I&#x27;ve bought since). Of course Doom 2 was $35 not $55, damn inflation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course I had to see &lt;a href=&quot;http://digitaldeals.net/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=11523&quot;&gt;this deal yesterday&lt;/a&gt;.  An &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.creative.com/products/product.asp?prodid=9103&quot;&gt;Audigy 2NX (Dolby 7.1, etc.)&lt;/a&gt; for only $52 and free shipping?  Considering the crappy onboard sound I have now, I was pretty much obligated to buy it.  So that doubled the price of the game so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then I had to get some 7.1 speakers to go along with it.  I saw &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.buy.com/retail/product.asp?sku=10355392&amp;loc=101&quot;&gt;these at buy.com&lt;/a&gt; and I couldn&#x27;t resist.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.creative.com/products/product.asp?prodid=5076&quot;&gt;Creative&#x27;s marketing BS&lt;/a&gt; even says that they&#x27;re the perfect compliment to the Audigy 2NX. So now the final tally of Doom 3 for me is &lt;strong title=&quot;$175?!?!? OMGWTF!?!&quot;&gt;$175!&lt;/strong&gt; Ah well, I need speakers and a better soundcard anyway.  Plus I&#x27;m sure Doom 3 is worth it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s made me wonder though.  If someone as cheap as me is spending this much money on the damn game, how many other people are going to be a sheep like me?  I think it&#x27;ll be bigger than Quake 3 was.  It will be a welcome boost to the PC industry.&lt;/p&gt;","enclosures":[],"source":{"url":"","title":""},"changefreq":"never","priority":"0.1","bodyArticleHtml":"<hgroup><h3><time datetime=\"2004-07-31T11:22:00.000Z\" pubdate=\"pubdate\">2004-07-31</time></h3><h1><a href=\"http://dieseltravis.github.io/posts/2004/07/31/doom-3-preorder\">Doom 3 preorder</a></h1><h2></h2></hgroup><p>I went to <a href="http:<p>OfcourseIhadtosee<ahref="http://digitaldeals.net/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=11523">thisdealyesterday</a>.An<ahref="http://www.creative.com/products/product.asp?prodid=9103">Audigy2NX(Dolby7.1,etc.)</a>foronly$52andfreeshipping?ConsideringthecrappyonboardsoundIhavenow,Iwasprettymuchobligatedtobuyit.Sothatdoubledthepriceofthegamesofar.</p><p>ThenIhadtogetsome7.1speakerstogoalongwithit.Isaw<ahref="http://www.buy.com/retail/product.asp?sku=10355392&loc=101">theseatbuy.com</a>andIcouldn'tresist.<ahref="http://www.creative.com/products/product.asp?prodid=5076">Creative'smarketingBS</a>evensaysthatthey'retheperfectcomplimenttotheAudigy2NX.SonowthefinaltallyofDoom3formeis<strongtitle="$175?!?!?
