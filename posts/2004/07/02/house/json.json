So it&#x27;s &lt;strong&gt;FINALLY&lt;/strong&gt; officially approved.  I made the original purchase offer back on April 4th (04/04/04), so it&#x27;s been awhile.  What sucks is that the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nyhomes.org/sony/intRate.html#RemodelNY&quot;&gt;interest rate&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nyhomes.org/sony/AchLim02.htm&quot;&gt;SONYMA&lt;/a&gt; (sunny may) went up a quarter of a percent just TWO STINKING days ago.  I wish I could reduce my offer by the amount of money the sellers bank has cost me by taking its sweet ass time.  Ah well, I&#x27;ll post pix and stuff later.
