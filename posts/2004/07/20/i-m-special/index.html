Kinda cool. I don't remember the details on what's included or comp'd and what-not, but it's still exciting. What's funny is just before I was told, I had my lunch cut short (by the client who no doubt made me the most profitable), I had problems using the damn fax machine for the second time today, I had to take a detour to my damn apartment because of the construction that was occurring directly in front of it, I met Sherry who had an interview go not as well as she expected, came outside to find out my neighbor's motorcycle had been stolen from his front yard directly across from mine the previous night/morning, and got back to work late for a meeting I had forgotten about (and too late to eat the pathetic lunch I had just rushed to get), which was the same meeting where I found out about the trip. Karma or just a bizarro twist? I don't really care I got a free trip.</article></main><nav><h2>Other Stuff</h2><ul><li><a href="/posts/2004/07/22/fake-foreskin" rel="prev">Fake Foreskin</a></li><li><a href="/posts/2004/07/20/firefox-user-css" rel="prev">Firefox User CSS</a></li><li><a href="/posts/2004/07/20/i-m-special" rel="self">I&#x27;m Special</a></li><li><a href="/posts/2004/07/16/i-guess-other-people-like-firefox-too" rel="next">I guess other people like Firefox too</a></li><li><a href="/posts/2004/07/13/three-more-useful-apps">Three more useful apps</a></li><li><a href="/posts" rel="archives">Archive</a></li><li><a href="/about" rel="about">About</a></li></ul><h3>Folks</h3><ul><li><a href="http://ern.me/" rel="friend met co-worker colleague" title="Ern is my co-worker">Ern</a></li><li><a href="http://www.larryroth.net/" rel="friend met co-worker colleague" title="Larry is my boss">Larry</a></li><li><a href="http://ralphwhitbeck.com/" rel="friend met" title="Ralph is a former co-worker">Ralph</a></li><li><a href="http://sherrybdesign.com/" rel="friend met co-resident spouse sweetheart" title="Sherry is a Graphic Designer and my wife">Sherry</a></li></ul><h3>Work-related</h3><ul><li><a href="http://brandlogic.com/" title="Brandlogic is where I work">Brandlogic</a></li><li><a href="http://www.corebrand.com/" title="CoreBrand is a full service brand consultancy">CoreBrand</a></li><li><a href="http://www.tapdash.net/" title="TapDash, made by Brandlogic, is a real-time view of customer experience">TapDash</a></li></ul></nav><div id="comments"><a id="disqus_comments" href="/posts/2004/07/20/i-m-special#disqus_thread">Comments</a><div id="disqus_thread"></div><p><a href="//disqus.com" class="dsq-brlink">comments powered by <span class="logo-disqus">Disqus</span></a></p></div><footer><h2>© Travis Hardiman, et al. 1979-2079.</h2><p>All puns intentional even if stated otherwise, all posts are owned by their respective owners, any code posted is public domain unless stated otherwise</p></footer><div id="weather"></div><script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.0.min.js"></script><script src="/j/mainScw.js"></script></body></html>
