A photographer from The Insider took our picture in the pet shop and told us to check the next issue. We ended up eating at Jine's for dinner and we had a nice window seat on the corner. As we were sitting down a couple cops were talking to a guy who's car hit a curb and had a flat tire. I saw a bottle on the top of the guys car as they were handcuffing him and putting him into the cop car, so I'm assuming that it was a DWI. Then the moron kicks out the back door window of the cop car. The one cop wrestled him to the ground right outside the car on top of all the broken glass. The guy was still resisting like an idiot, and another cop had to help. They were struggling for a few minutes when the entire police department showed up along with 2 firetrucks and 2 ambulances. They pepper-sprayed him at least once and put a bag over his head. It drew a huge crowd that blocked the view, so I probably missed a bunch of cool stuff because it took at least half an hour for them to get the idiot into an ambulance. My neck is sore from watching the whole thing while I was eating. It was funny to hear the stories people were telling each other about what happened. By the end of the night, the dude was on all kinds of drugs, he smashed the cop's window with his head (ha!), the car was stolen, he smashed in other car windows, and a bunch of other things. I didn't see evidence of any of that stuff but maybe it happened to occur when people were blocking my view.</p><p>I had the Gyro Platter that came with spanakopita, dolmates, and a salad, it was great.</p></div></article></main><nav><h2>Other Stuff</h2><ul><li><a href="/posts/2004/12/07/the-rise-of-the-monkey-clone-army">The Rise of the Monkey-Clone Army</a></li><li><a href="/posts/2004/12/05/boredom" rel="prev">boredom</a></li><li><a href="/posts/2004/12/02/cops-park-ave" rel="self">COPS: Park Ave</a></li><li><a href="/posts/2004/11/30/npr-paul-reubens-interview-aka-pee-wee-herman" rel="next">NPR Paul Reubens interview (AKA Pee Wee Herman)</a></li><li><a href="/posts/2004/11/30/gouranga">Gouranga?</a></li><li><a href="/posts" rel="archives ">Archive</a></li><li><a href="/about" rel="about ">About</a></li><li><a href="/tools">Tools</a></li><li><gcse:searchbox-only></gcse:searchbox-only></li></ul><h3>Folks</h3><ul><li><a href="http://ern.me/" rel="friend met co-worker colleague" title="Ern is my co-worker">Ern</a></li><li><a href="http://www.larryroth.net/" rel="friend met co-worker colleague" title="Larry is my boss">Larry</a></li><li><a href="http://ralphwhitbeck.com/" rel="friend met" title="Ralph is a former co-worker">Ralph</a></li><li><a href="http://sherrybdesign.com/" rel="friend met co-resident spouse sweetheart" title="Sherry is a Graphic Designer and my wife">Sherry</a></li></ul><h3>Work-related</h3><ul><li><a href="http://brandlogic.com/" title="Brandlogic is where I work">Brandlogic</a></li><li><a href="http://www.corebrand.com/" title="CoreBrand is a full service brand consultancy">CoreBrand</a></li><li><a href="http://www.tapdash.net/" title="TapDash, made by Brandlogic, is a real-time view of customer experience">TapDash</a></li></ul></nav><div id="comments"><a id="disqus_comments" href="/posts/2004/12/02/cops-park-ave#disqus_thread">Comments</a><div id="archived_comments"><h2>Archived Comments</h2><table><thead><tr><th>name</th><th>date</th><th>comment</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href="http://www.mediagab.com/blog">Ralph </a></td><td><time datetime="2004-12-07T20:57:00.000Z" pubdate="pubdate">2004-12-07 03:57</time></td><td>Wow that is freakin nuts</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div id="disqus_thread"></div><p><a href="//disqus.com" class="dsq-brlink">comments powered by <span class="logo-disqus">Disqus</span></a></p></div><footer><h2>© Travis Hardiman, et al. 1979-2079.</h2><p>All puns intentional even if stated otherwise, all posts are owned by their respective owners, any code posted is public domain unless stated otherwise</p></footer><div id="weather"></div><script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.0.min.js"></script><script src="/j/maina0z.js"></script></body></html>
