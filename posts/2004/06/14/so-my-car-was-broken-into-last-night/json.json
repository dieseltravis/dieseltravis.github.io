She checked the caller ID and it was from my cellphone, so she called my apartment.  The night before I had gotten in around 11:15pm or so, and my car had been full of Sherry&#x27;s stuff (the first  carload of many).  The car was parked a few houses down from mine and I could see some stuffed animals on the ground from my apartment.  I got closer to see that all four doors weren&#x27;t closed all the way and I looked inside to have the pleasure of seeing my dash ripped open and my stereo missing.  I&#x27;m too mad to check to see if any of Sherry&#x27;s stuff is missing now and I don&#x27;t wanna mess up the crime scene any before the cops get here.  I really hope none of her stuff is missing, that would just send me over the edge.  Some of her stuff was from her now deceased grand parents so it isn&#x27;t exactly replaceable.  So far it looks like just the stereo and cellphone.  My 12 disc changer laid happily in plain sight on the driver&#x27;s side floor.  I guess some dude allegedly found my cell phone near Dewey &amp;amp; Birr st.  I have his pager, prolly call the dude later after I talk to the police again (if I talk to the police again).  Anyways, pics and prolly more updates to follow.&lt;br/&gt;:-(&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;08:44 - Well, I checked out my car a little better.  It appears that just my cellphone and stereo were stolen.  I still have to call the kid who has my cell phone.  The thieves were nice enough to leave me a craftsman flathead screwdriver, so at least I got something out of the deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;18:25 - Apparently city cops only investigate these types of crime scenes if there were a chain of cars broken into so I guess I&#x27;m on my own.  Now if I could just get the dude to answer my phone or call me back.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;19:09 - Meeting &quot;Mike&quot; at Coliseum Pizza (on Dewey near Ridgeway) at 9 tonight to get my phone back.  Unless it&#x27;s an Ackbar and I get gangbustered, hehe.

If you ever get &quot;Mike&quot; the delivery dude, give &#x27;em a phatty tip.
