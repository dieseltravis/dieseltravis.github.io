She checked the caller ID and it was from my cellphone, so she called my apartment. The night before I had gotten in around 11:15pm or so, and my car had been full of Sherry's stuff (the first carload of many). The car was parked a few houses down from mine and I could see some stuffed animals on the ground from my apartment. I got closer to see that all four doors weren't closed all the way and I looked inside to have the pleasure of seeing my dash ripped open and my stereo missing. I'm too mad to check to see if any of Sherry's stuff is missing now and I don't wanna mess up the crime scene any before the cops get here. I really hope none of her stuff is missing, that would just send me over the edge. Some of her stuff was from her now deceased grand parents so it isn't exactly replaceable. So far it looks like just the stereo and cellphone. My 12 disc changer laid happily in plain sight on the driver's side floor. I guess some dude allegedly found my cell phone near Dewey &amp; Birr st. I have his pager, prolly call the dude later after I talk to the police again (if I talk to the police again). Anyways, pics and prolly more updates to follow.<br/>:-(<br/><br/>08:44 - Well, I checked out my car a little better. It appears that just my cellphone and stereo were stolen. I still have to call the kid who has my cell phone. The thieves were nice enough to leave me a craftsman flathead screwdriver, so at least I got something out of the deal.<br/><br/>18:25 - Apparently city cops only investigate these types of crime scenes if there were a chain of cars broken into so I guess I'm on my own. Now if I could just get the dude to answer my phone or call me back.<br/><br/>19:09 - Meeting "Mike" at Coliseum Pizza (on Dewey near Ridgeway) at 9 tonight to get my phone back. Unless it's an Ackbar and I get gangbustered, hehe. Ah well, here's some pics:<br/>Before: <a href="http://travis.servebeer.com/blog.net/gallery/image/5.aspx" title="before"><img src="http://travis.servebeer.com/blog.net/images/20/r_IMG_0817.JPG" alt="before"/></a><br/><br/>After: <a href="http://travis.servebeer.com/blog.net/gallery/image/6.aspx" title="after"><img src="http://travis.servebeer.com/blog.net/images/20/r_IMG_1868.JPG" alt="after"/></a><br/><br/>21:36 - Yay cell phone. I'd also like to plug <a href="http://local.google.com/local?sc=1&amp;q=Coliseum+Pizza&amp;near=rochester%2C+ny&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;sl=1">Coliseum Pizza</a>, they deliver anywhere in Monroe County 11am until <strong>4AM</strong>. If you ever get "Mike" the delivery dude, give 'em a phatty tip. And thanx to Ern for folowing my ass out there, and being Johnny-on-the-spot with the "9" and the "1", just in case.</div></article></main><nav><h2>Other Stuff</h2><ul><li><a href="/posts/2004/06/15/piss-off-ie-users">Piss off IE users</a></li><li><a href="/posts/2004/06/14/mozilla-firefox-0-9-is-here" rel="prev">Mozilla Firefox 0.9 Is Here!</a></li><li><a href="/posts/2004/06/14/so-my-car-was-broken-into-last-night" rel="self">So my car was broken into last night</a></li><li><a href="/posts/2004/06/11/over-10-adoption-of-mozilla" rel="next">Over 10% adoption of Mozilla?</a></li><li><a href="/posts/2004/06/11/suck-it-lassie">Suck it Lassie</a></li><li><a href="/posts" rel="archives ">Archive</a></li><li><a href="/about" rel="about ">About</a></li><li><gcse:searchbox-only></gcse:searchbox-only></li></ul><h3>Folks</h3><ul><li><a href="http://ern.me/" rel="friend met co-worker colleague" title="Ern is my co-worker">Ern</a></li><li><a href="http://www.larryroth.net/" rel="friend met co-worker colleague" title="Larry is my boss">Larry</a></li><li><a href="http://ralphwhitbeck.com/" rel="friend met" title="Ralph is a former co-worker">Ralph</a></li><li><a href="http://sherrybdesign.com/" rel="friend met co-resident spouse sweetheart" title="Sherry is a Graphic Designer and my wife">Sherry</a></li></ul><h3>Work-related</h3><ul><li><a href="http://brandlogic.com/" title="Brandlogic is where I work">Brandlogic</a></li><li><a href="http://www.corebrand.com/" title="CoreBrand is a full service brand consultancy">CoreBrand</a></li><li><a href="http://www.tapdash.net/" title="TapDash, made by Brandlogic, is a real-time view of customer experience">TapDash</a></li></ul></nav><div id="comments"><a id="disqus_comments" href="/posts/2004/06/14/so-my-car-was-broken-into-last-night#disqus_thread">Comments</a><div id="archived_comments"><h2>Archived Comments</h2><table><thead><tr><th>name</th><th>date</th><th>comment</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>andy </td><td><time datetime="2004-06-14T19:26:00.000Z" pubdate="pubdate">2004-06-14 03:26</time></td><td>Sorry to hear about that. It's a shame that the cops aren't interested in solving crimes like this. People that break into cars will probably keep doing it until they get caught, so hopefully your thief will end up in your friendly neighborhood pound-me-in-the-ass prison.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="http://travis.servebeer.com/blog.net/">travis </a></td><td><time datetime="2004-06-14T20:12:00.000Z" pubdate="pubdate">2004-06-14 04:12</time></td><td>Yeah, it's definitely a bummer. I guess it's time for a new head unit, and maybe an alarm. Hopefully my deductible is less than the damage.</td></tr><tr><td>Uncle John </td><td><time datetime="2004-06-14T21:32:00.000Z" pubdate="pubdate">2004-06-14 05:32</time></td><td>GODDAMMIT, I hate that SHIT!!!<br><br>You have my most sincere sympathy.<br><br>Uncle John<br>The Lawless West.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="http://redwolves2.myftp.org">Ralph </a></td><td><time datetime="2004-06-16T16:40:00.000Z" pubdate="pubdate">2004-06-16 12:40</time></td><td>So what did the insurance company say?</td></tr><tr><td><a href="http://travis.servebeer.com/blog.net/">travis </a></td><td><time datetime="2004-07-01T12:47:00.000Z" pubdate="pubdate">2004-07-01 08:47</time></td><td>Yay, all the damage was only $10 over my deductible. I can't wait to get that check for $10 that is co-written out to my lienholder. Woo hoo. Those jerks. I guess all that money paid towards comprehensive isn't worth it, I'll have to cancel that as soon as I get a chance.</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div id="disqus_thread"></div><p><a href="//disqus.com" class="dsq-brlink">comments powered by <span class="logo-disqus">Disqus</span></a></p></div><footer><h2>© Travis Hardiman, et al. 1979-2079.</h2><p>All puns intentional even if stated otherwise, all posts are owned by their respective owners, any code posted is public domain unless stated otherwise</p></footer><div id="weather"></div><script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.0.min.js"></script><script src="/j/mainUNq.js"></script></body></html>
