Kinda bizarre. The neighbors convinced her to call the police and when she did, <strong>two</strong> showed up at her house, letting her know that they'd see if they could find her plant. But in Rochester, when you have <a href="http://travis.servebeer.com/blog.net/archive/2004/06/14/some_assholes_broke_into_my_car.aspx" title="assholes...">hundreds of dollars in damage to your vehicle</a>, your stereo stolen, plus fingerprint AND footprint evidence - you aren't even given the courtesy of a visit by a single cop. Score one for small towns, I guess. My landlord was telling me that someone he knew actually had a tree stolen from his front yard. The thief didn't even have a truck waiting or anything. I guess there was a trail of dirt that went on for three blocks. They never found out who did it and never saw the tree again.</article></main><nav><h2>Other Stuff</h2><ul><li><a href="/posts/2004/06/29/firefox-0-9-1" rel="prev">Firefox 0.9.1</a></li><li><a href="/posts/2004/06/28/iraq-s-new-flag" rel="prev">Iraq&#x27;s new flag</a></li><li><a href="/posts/2004/06/27/bored-cops-busy-cops-damn-thiefs" rel="self">Bored Cops/Busy Cops (damn thiefs)</a></li><li><a href="/posts/2004/06/23/ditch-those-aim-ads" rel="next">Ditch those AIM ads</a></li><li><a href="/posts/2004/06/23/migrating-from-hotmail-to-gmail">Migrating from Hotmail to GMail</a></li><li><a href="/posts" rel="archives">Archive</a></li><li><a href="/about" rel="about">About</a></li></ul><h3>Folks</h3><ul><li><a href="http://ern.me/" rel="friend met co-worker colleague" title="Ern is my co-worker">Ern</a></li><li><a href="http://www.larryroth.net/" rel="friend met co-worker colleague" title="Larry is my boss">Larry</a></li><li><a href="http://ralphwhitbeck.com/" rel="friend met" title="Ralph is a former co-worker">Ralph</a></li><li><a href="http://sherrybdesign.com/" rel="friend met co-resident spouse sweetheart" title="Sherry is a Graphic Designer and my wife">Sherry</a></li></ul><h3>Work-related</h3><ul><li><a href="http://brandlogic.com/" title="Brandlogic is where I work">Brandlogic</a></li><li><a href="http://www.corebrand.com/" title="CoreBrand is a full service brand consultancy">CoreBrand</a></li><li><a href="http://www.tapdash.net/" title="TapDash, made by Brandlogic, is a real-time view of customer experience">TapDash</a></li></ul></nav><div id="comments"><a id="disqus_comments" href="/posts/2004/06/27/bored-cops-busy-cops-damn-thiefs#disqus_thread">Comments</a><div id="archived_comments"><h2>Archived Comments</h2><table><thead><tr><th>name</th><th>date</th><th>comment</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><img src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e?s=32&d=retro&r=r" class="gravatar" alt="Adam Lindsay gravatar"/> Adam Lindsay </td><td><time datetime="2004-07-07T18:37:00.000Z" pubdate="pubdate">2004-07-07 02:37</time></td><td>We have an election coming up this November.
