I&#x27;m still working at it, and I&#x27;m currently stumped.  Unfortunately the &lt;a href=&quot;http://forums.mozillazine.org&quot;&gt;mozillazine forums&lt;/a&gt; are down.  I usually ask questions like this in the extensions forum there.  I &lt;a href=&quot;http://travis.servebeer.com/blog.net/articles/imagezoomer.aspx&quot;&gt;made a page which tests the actual JS (which has been updated)&lt;/a&gt; that is used inside the extension and it works fine.  Unfortunately the problem I&#x27;m currently running into is that the extension will not fully install (the about screen works at least). Feel free to &lt;a href=&quot;http://travis.servebeer.com/imagezoomer/imageZoomer-v0_2.xpi&quot;&gt;d/l the xpi&lt;/a&gt; and tell me wtf I&#x27;m doing wrong. I think it&#x27;s most likely in install.rdf, or possibly one of the contents.rdf files, I&#x27;m pretty sure it isn&#x27;t an XUL error, and I&#x27;m almost positive it has nothing to do with my JS.  This bug is really a major showstopper and I need to get past it to continue development.  (Once I do get past this first issue, I may need help with all of those TODO thingies in there too :-/ )&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Update]: Yay, it works in 0.9/0.9.1 now!  Please test it and let me know how it works for you.
