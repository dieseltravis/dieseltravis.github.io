Of the five computers in the benchmark, it is the cheapest at a &lt;em&gt;mere&lt;/em&gt; $3075.  What is really surprising is that it beats out the Mac &lt;strong&gt;Dual&lt;/strong&gt; G5 which has &lt;strong&gt;2x&lt;/strong&gt; the CPUs, &lt;strong&gt;3x the RAM&lt;/strong&gt;, and it costs over &lt;strong&gt;$1300&lt;/strong&gt; more than the Alienware&#x27;s &lt;strong&gt;laptop&lt;/strong&gt;! I remember a time when DV editing was one of Apple&#x27;s strong-points but it get&#x27;s smoked by the laptop in just about every area.  They do still shine in the &quot;starving artist&quot; category where artists who use the Macs will be starving after coughing up all that dough and not being able to put out work faster.&lt;/p&gt;","enclosures":[],"source":{"url":"","title":""},"changefreq":"never","priority":"0.1","bodyArticleHtml":"<hgroup><h3><time datetime=\"2004-08-27T17:20:00.000Z\" pubdate=\"pubdate\">2004-08-27</time></h3><h1><a href=\"http://travis.servebeer.com/posts/2004/08/27/alienware-notebook-for-badass-video-editing\">Alienware Notebook for badass video editing</a></h1><h2></h2></hgroup><p>I came across <a href="http:</p>",	"bodyNavItems": [								{									"pageRel": "prev",								"href": "/posts/2004/09/02/screw-lasik",				"text": "ScrewLASIK"			}					, 			{									"pageRel": "prev",								"href": "/posts/2004/09/01/pop-is-bad",				"text": "Popisbad"			}					, 			{									"pageRel": "self",								"href": "/posts/2004/08/27/alienware-notebook-for-badass-video-editing",				"text": "AlienwareNotebookforbadassvideoediting"			}					, 			{									"pageRel": "next",								"href": "/posts/2004/08/27/posting-and-you",				"text": "PostingandYou"			}					, 			{								"href": "/posts/2004/08/26/ron-burgundy-says-it-s-the-greatest-song-ever-or-he-ll-fight-you",				"text": "RonBurgundysaysit&#x27;sthegreatestsongever-orhe&#x27;llfightyou"			}			]}
