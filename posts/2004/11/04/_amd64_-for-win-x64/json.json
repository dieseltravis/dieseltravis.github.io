The presenter just finished explaining that the compiler-time variable to test for the x64 version of Windows is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;code&gt;#if define(_AMD64)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then these questions followed:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Question: _AMD64_ is a definition for both AMD64 and EM64T Intel, right?&lt;br /&gt;Answer: Yes. In the source code and header files _AMD64 applies to X64 as well.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Question: Will _AMD64_ be changed to _X64_? Will the Visual Studio 2005 platform &quot;Win64 (AMD64)&quot; be renamed?&lt;br /&gt;Answer: At present there are no plans to make these changes.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;He explained how at the time of development Intel had no plans whatsoever to release a 64-bit processor, and by the time they did announce it, it was way too late to change the constant&#x27;s name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can&#x27;t imagine being an Intel developer, writing drivers or something along those lines, and having to use _AMD64_. Talk about rubbing their noses in it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer: Every PC I currently own runs on AMD hardware, and as of this post I own shares of AMD.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","enclosures":[],"source":{"url":"","title":""},"changefreq":"never","priority":"0.1","bodyArticleHtml":"<hgroup><h3><time datetime=\"2004-11-04T11:45:00.000Z\" pubdate=\"pubdate\">2004-11-04</time></h3><h1><a href=\"http://travis.servebeer.com/posts/2004/11/04/_amd64_-for-win-x64\">_AMD64_ for Win x64</a></h1><h2></h2></hgroup><p>I've been playing some <a href="http:<code>#ifdefine(_AMD64)</code><br/>Thenthesequestionsfollowed:</p><blockquote>Question:_AMD64_isadefinitionforbothAMD64andEM64TIntel,right?<br/>Answer:Yes.Inthesourcecodeandheaderfiles_AMD64appliestoX64aswell.</blockquote><blockquote>Question:Will_AMD64_bechangedto_X64_?WilltheVisualStudio2005platform"Win64 (AMD64)"berenamed?<br/>Answer:Atpresenttherearenoplanstomakethesechanges.</blockquote><p>HeexplainedhowatthetimeofdevelopmentIntelhadnoplanswhatsoevertoreleasea64-bitprocessor,andbythetimetheydidannounceit,itwaswaytoolatetochangetheconstant'sname.</p><p>Ican'timaginebeinganInteldeveloper,writingdriversorsomethingalongthoselines,andhavingtouse_AMD64_.Talkaboutrubbingtheirnosesinit.</p><p><em>Disclaimer:EveryPCIcurrentlyownrunsonAMDhardware,andasofthispostIownsharesofAMD.</em></p>",	"bodyNavItems": [								{									"pageRel": "prev",								"href": "/posts/2004/11/09/firefox-1-0",				"text": "Firefox1.0"			}					, 			{									"pageRel": "prev",								"href": "/posts/2004/11/05/code-compiles-faster-on-x64",				"text": "Codecompilesfasteronx64"			}					, 			{									"pageRel": "self",								"href": "/posts/2004/11/04/_amd64_-for-win-x64",				"text": "_AMD64_forWinx64"			}					, 			{									"pageRel": "next",								"href": "/posts/2004/11/04/votergate-tv",				"text": "votergate.tv"			}					, 			{								"href": "/posts/2004/11/03/obama-in-08",				"text": "Obamain&#x27;08"			}			]}
