This trend would continue and allow US companies to spend more money on US workers, the study says. Looking ahead, 317,000 new jobs would be created due to outsourcing.&quot;  Of course, the study should probably be taken with a grain of salt: &quot;The study was sponsored by the ITAA which represents more than 11,000 IT companies in the US, including corporations such as IBM, one vocal proponent of outsourcing.&quot;  There&#x27;s still a difference of 14,000 jobs.  I&#x27;m kinda on the fence on the whole outsourcing thing.  On one hand, I don&#x27;t want to lose my job or have my pay cut, but on the other one I don&#x27;t blame companies for hiring workers who&#x27;ll work for cheaper - as long as they do the same quality of work.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://redwolves2.myftp.org/blog/archive/2004/03/20/187.aspx&quot;&gt;Customer service would be the last place I would outsource though&lt;/a&gt;.
