I haven&#x27;t tried it yet, but it looks like it might have a sweet feature or two.  Most notably the ability to extract inline styles and export them to a single document.  Considering the amount of junk HTML I&#x27;ve had handed to me lately, this might come in useful.  Hopefully it&#x27;s as easily extensible as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/&quot;&gt;FireFox&lt;/a&gt; is.  It&#x27;s originally made for the Lindows platform (ugh), but there are also &lt;a href=&quot;http://webperso.easyconnect.fr/danielglazman/whyNvu/nvu.html&quot;&gt;test binaries available for Windows and Linux&lt;/a&gt;.  I&#x27;ll have to try it out and see how it performs - since it&#x27;s a 0.2 test release, I don&#x27;t expect it to work 100%.","enclosures":[],"source":{"url":"","title":""},"changefreq":"never","priority":"0.1","bodyArticleHtml":"<hgroup><h3><time datetime=\"2004-03-30T17:44:00.000Z\" pubdate=\"pubdate\">2004-03-30</time></h3><h1><a href=\"http://travis.servebeer.com/posts/2004/03/30/nvu-0-2\">Nvu 0.2</a></h1><h2></h2></hgroup><a href="http:"bodyNavItems":[{"pageRel":"prev","href":"/posts/2004/03/31/the-governator","text":"The Governator"},{"pageRel":"prev","href":"/posts/2004/03/31/us-jobs-created-from-outsourcing","text":"US jobs created from outsourcing?"},{"pageRel":"self","href":"/posts/2004/03/30/nvu-0-2","text":"Nvu 0.2"},{"pageRel":"next","href":"/posts/2004/03/30/office-space","text":"Office Space"},{"href":"/posts/2004/03/30/where-does-adult-swim-get-its-ironic-and-self-referential-humor-from","text":"Where does Adult Swim get its ironic and self-referential humor from?"}]}
