Although I specifically opted to NOT install a boot manager of any kind, after rebooting, I can no longer boot into Windows. You'd think that I'd learn not to attempt an OS installation at 2:30am. After some quick googling, I think I can restore the boot sector by running fdisk /mbr, but I don' t want to screw things up worse.<br><br>I've cross-posted my BSD BS onto several message boards, so I'll wait till I get a few responses before I do anything drastic.<br><br><a href="http://forums.planetamd64.com/viewtopic.php?p=2787#2787">Planet AMD64 Forum Index -&gt; Operating Systems</a><br><br><a href="http://forum.msi.com.tw/thread.php?threadid=45482&sid=">MSI HQ User Community Forum » AMD64 based board</a><br><br><a href="http://forums.viaarena.com/messageview.cfm?catid=28&threadid=53674">Via Arena &gt; FORUMS &gt; OS Arena &gt; Linux Arena</a><br><br><a href="http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/showthread.php?s=&threadid=161128">LinuxQuestions.org &gt; Forums &gt; *BSD</a><br><br>[EDIT] Well the first thing I tried was fdisk /mbr. After rebooting I could now see the C:, but I got the message OS not installed. So then I tried running some stuff from the XP cd in restore mode (fixboot, fixmbr, bootconfig, etc.). Now when I rebooted I got the NTLDR Is Missing. So then I went through a bunch of complicated steps in a MS Knowledge base article. I still ended up with the NTLDR message. So I threw in the ME CD and began re-installing that onto the C drive, I chose to back-up existing system files and setup crashed during this process and gave me a useless hexadecimal Dos error. After restarting, going into setup, skipping system backup, ME setup now got to 67% complete when I got a SUWIN error. I hit Ignore several thousand times and setup finally completed. After rebooting 5 times, I was back to a functioning machine again. My boot.ini was still intact so my other OSs were left unharmed. The whole process took less than 5 hours ;-) (most was spent googling)<br><br>I really want to try *nix/*BSD, but so far it's been nothing but a hassle. Are there any easy to use *nix/*BSD installers, or am I stuck waiting for YaST when SuSE 9.1 comes out in May?<br><br>[EDIT again] I think I should also add that not a single bit of important data was lost during this entire process.</div></article></main><nav><h2>Other Stuff</h2><ul><li><a href="/posts/2004/03/24/h4x0r5">h4x0r5</a></li><li><a href="/posts/2004/03/23/top-ten" rel="prev">Top Ten</a></li><li><a href="/posts/2004/03/22/freebsd-installation-attempt-corrupted-the-boot-sector-yay" rel="self">FreeBSD installation attempt corrupted the boot sector, yay!</a></li><li><a href="/posts/2004/03/19/ipod-still-sucks" rel="next">iPod [still] sucks</a></li><li><a href="/posts/2004/03/19/file-u-s-income-tax-return-online-without-spending-a-dime">File U.S. Income Tax Return Online Without Spending a Dime</a></li><li><a href="/posts" rel="archives ">Archive</a></li><li><a href="/about" rel="about ">About</a></li><li><a href="/tools">Tools</a></li><li><gcse:searchbox-only></gcse:searchbox-only></li></ul><h3>Folks</h3><ul><li><a href="http://ern.me/" rel="friend met co-worker colleague" title="Ern is my co-worker">Ern</a></li><li><a href="http://www.larryroth.net/" rel="friend met co-worker colleague" title="Larry is my boss">Larry</a></li><li><a href="http://ralphwhitbeck.com/" rel="friend met" title="Ralph is a former co-worker">Ralph</a></li><li><a href="http://sherrybdesign.com/" rel="friend met co-resident spouse sweetheart" title="Sherry is a Graphic Designer and my wife">Sherry</a></li></ul><h3>Work-related</h3><ul><li><a href="http://brandlogic.com/" title="Brandlogic is where I work">Brandlogic</a></li><li><a href="http://www.corebrand.com/" title="CoreBrand is a full service brand consultancy">CoreBrand</a></li><li><a href="http://www.tapdash.net/" title="TapDash, made by Brandlogic, is a real-time view of customer experience">TapDash</a></li></ul></nav><div id="comments"><a id="disqus_comments" href="/posts/2004/03/22/freebsd-installation-attempt-corrupted-the-boot-sector-yay#disqus_thread">Comments</a><div id="archived_comments"><h2>Archived Comments</h2><table><thead><tr><th>name</th><th>date</th><th>comment</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href="http://www.shop-all-day.com">Ralph </a></td><td><time datetime="2004-03-24T10:44:00.000Z" pubdate="pubdate">2004-03-24 06:44</time></td><td>&quot;I think I should also add that not a single bit of important data was lost during this entire process. &quot;<br><br>That's good it's a terrible thing to see good porn lost to a BSD install.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="http://travis.servebeer.com/blog.net">travis </a></td><td><time datetime="2004-03-24T12:18:00.000Z" pubdate="pubdate">2004-03-24 08:18</time></td><td>what's sad, is that BSD didn't even install, it crapped out. The only thing it managed to do was F up my boot process. I noticed last night that my XP64 and LH64 partitions still aren't bootable, so I'll probably have to do some crazy recovery console shenanigans on those installations as well. Just when I think &quot;why do i even bother?&quot;, my curiosity sets in. I just wanna run 64-bit seti in a 64-bit OS, and browse with 64 bit fire[whatever], with no emulation modes.</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div id="disqus_thread"></div><p><a href="//disqus.com" class="dsq-brlink">comments powered by <span class="logo-disqus">Disqus</span></a></p></div><footer><h2>© Travis Hardiman, et al. 1979-2079.</h2><p>All puns intentional even if stated otherwise, all posts are owned by their respective owners, any code posted is public domain unless stated otherwise</p></footer><div id="weather"></div><script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.0.min.js"></script><script src="/j/mainY2a.js"></script></body></html>
