After rebooting I could now see the C:, but I got the message OS not installed.  So then I tried running some stuff from the XP cd in restore mode (fixboot, fixmbr, bootconfig, etc.).  Now when I rebooted I got the NTLDR Is Missing.  So then I went through a bunch of complicated steps in a MS Knowledge base article.  I still ended up with the NTLDR message.  So I threw in the ME CD and began re-installing that onto the C drive, I chose to back-up existing system files and setup crashed during this process and gave me a useless hexadecimal Dos error.  After restarting, going into setup, skipping system backup, ME setup now got to 67% complete when I got a SUWIN error.  I hit Ignore several thousand times and setup finally completed.  After rebooting 5 times, I was back to a functioning machine again.  My boot.ini was still intact so my other OSs were left unharmed.  The whole process took less than 5 hours ;-)  (most was spent googling)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I really want to try *nix/*BSD, but so far it&#x27;s been nothing but a hassle.  Are there any easy to use *nix/*BSD installers, or am I stuck waiting for YaST when SuSE 9.1 comes out in May?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[EDIT again] I think I should also add that not a single bit of important data was lost during this entire process.","enclosures":[],"source":{"url":"","title":""},"changefreq":"never","priority":"0.1","bodyArticleHtml":"<hgroup><h3><time datetime=\"2004-03-22T20:30:00.000Z\" pubdate=\"pubdate\">2004-03-22</time></h3><h1><a href=\"http://travis.servebeer.com/posts/2004/03/22/freebsd-installation-attempt-corrupted-the-boot-sector-yay\">FreeBSD installation attempt corrupted the boot sector, yay!</a></h1><h2></h2></hgroup>I got some kind of disk error while trying to install FreeBSD 5.2.1 x86-64.
