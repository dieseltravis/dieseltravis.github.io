It was hosted by Shannen Dougherty and was loaded with lots of bits of useless info, I'll summarize the trivia below:<br><br>Hot dogs:<br>- hot dogs were first sold here by German immigrants for 10¢ each<br>- Nathan's hot dogs was started by a Jewish immigrant from Poland<br>- they sold them for 5¢ each and were very unpopular at first because people doubted their quality, even though they were made from top quality beef<br>- Nathan's decided to give free hot dogs to all doctors who came there with their labcoats on, after people saw that doctors were eating them, they exploded in popularity<br><br>Hamburgers:<br>- ground beef originated from Germany and was sold only in the finest restaraunts as Hamburg Style Steak<br>- it was later sold in stands to factory workers as meatballs, until an impatient cook started squashing them down with his spatula because they weren't cooking fast enough on the grill<br>- later they were first served in a bun at a state fair to make it easier for people to eat on the go<br>- White Castle was the first chain to serve hamburgers, the place was washed inside and out daily, and the meat was ground right in front of the customers<br>- McDonalds later sprung up and its grand opening was nearly a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/president/gwbbio.html">miserable failure</a> (sorry I couldn't resist), customers were all waiting in their cars to be served not realizing they had to go inside<br>- Buger King and Wendy's opened and the success of each was doubted by critics who didn't think the American public needed another burger joint<br><br>Pizza:<br>- originated in Greece (focaccia bread)<br>- brought into this country by Italian immigrants<br>- originally served cold to factory workers who put the cardboard boxes onto the radiators and ate the warmed pizza for lunch and later dinner<br>- exploded in popularity after the World Wars when the US GIs came back from Italy craving the pizza they ate there<br>- Pizza Hut was the first chain to sell pizza, the only reason for the "hut" was because it was the only word that fit on their sign that made sense<br>- deep dish pizza, "Chicago Style", was invented by Pizzeria Uno's<br>- the first place to deliver Pizza was Domino's<br>- the original was named Dominic's, it was so popular that two more were opened and named Domino's, that is why the domino logo has the 3 dots on it<br>- shortly after Domino's opened, pizza surpassed Chinese food as being the number 1 delivered food (1969, I think)<br><br>Fried Chicken:<br>- 'Colonel' Sanders dropped out of school in the 7th grade, he worked many jobs and had a hard time holding a steady one<br>- his fried chicken was originally sold out of a gas station off of a Kentucky interstate<br>- the chicken was so popular that they had to greatly expand the service station to support all the customers they got<br>- the interstate was re-routed and the the service station rapidly went out of business<br>- 'Colonel' Sanders wandered the country selling his blend of 11 spices and herbs to different restaraunts<br>- finally one of the owners liked it so much that he decided to start a chain with Sanders that would sell the "Kentucky fried" chicken<br>- the chain was a huge success and Sanders was named an honorary Colonel by the governor<br>- the whole reason that it is served in buckets is because they accidentally ordered way too many cardboard buckets, they found that 14 pieces fit perfect in them and paired it up with a few sides for $4.something<br><br>Ribs:<br>- originally they were made by slaves for their white owners' parties, they found a whole pig was just big enough<br>- after slavery was abolished the best barbeque techniques and recipes remained with the now freed slaves<br>- during segregation the only barbeque joints that sold ribs were located in the "black only" parts of towns<br>- these rib joints were the first places to have the segregation barriers broken<br>- limosines would pull up to rib joints located in the poorest sections of towns because the food was just that good<br><br><br>One of the things that I found most interesting about this show was that all these foods were originally served by the poorest people to the poorest people. All of these "All American" foods were created or originally made by immigrants to this country.<br><br>(I'll probably update this as I remember more info from the show)</div></article></main><nav><h2>Other Stuff</h2><ul><li><a href="/posts/2004/03/26/419-collection">419 collection</a></li><li><a href="/posts/2004/03/25/one-nation" rel="prev">&quot;One Nation...&quot;</a></li><li><a href="/posts/2004/03/24/guy-foods-on-the-history-channel" rel="self">&#x27;Guy Foods&#x27; on the History Channel</a></li><li><a href="/posts/2004/03/24/h4x0r5" rel="next">h4x0r5</a></li><li><a href="/posts/2004/03/23/top-ten">Top Ten</a></li><li><a href="/posts" rel="archives ">Archive</a></li><li><a href="/about" rel="about ">About</a></li><li><a href="/tools">Tools</a></li><li><gcse:searchbox-only></gcse:searchbox-only></li></ul><h3>Folks</h3><ul><li><a href="http://ern.me/" rel="friend met co-worker colleague" title="Ern is my co-worker">Ern</a></li><li><a href="http://www.larryroth.net/" rel="friend met co-worker colleague" title="Larry is my boss">Larry</a></li><li><a href="http://ralphwhitbeck.com/" rel="friend met" title="Ralph is a former co-worker">Ralph</a></li><li><a href="http://sherrybdesign.com/" rel="friend met co-resident spouse sweetheart" title="Sherry is a Graphic Designer and my wife">Sherry</a></li></ul><h3>Work-related</h3><ul><li><a href="http://tenetpartners.com/" title="Tenet is where I work">Tenet Partners</a></li><li><a href="http://www.tapdash.net/" title="TapDash, made by Tenet, is a real-time view of customer experience">TapDash</a></li></ul></nav><div id="comments"><a id="disqus_comments" href="/posts/2004/03/24/guy-foods-on-the-history-channel#disqus_thread">Comments</a><div id="disqus_thread"></div><p><a href="//disqus.com" class="dsq-brlink">comments powered by <span class="logo-disqus">Disqus</span></a></p></div><footer><h2>© Travis Hardiman, et al. 1979-2079.</h2><p>All puns intentional even if stated otherwise, all posts are owned by their respective owners, any code posted is public domain unless stated otherwise</p></footer><div id="weather"></div><script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.0.min.js"></script><script src="/j/main2Aon.js"></script></body></html>
