There is actually a site &lt;a href=&quot;http://jayzconstructionset.com/&quot;&gt;devoted solely to remixing Jay-Z&#x27;s Black Album&lt;/a&gt;.  I still think that the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.illegal-art.org/audio/grey.html&quot;&gt;Grey Album&lt;/a&gt; is the best so far (Beatles - White Album mash up), but I&#x27;m eager to find something better.  I&#x27;ve just started listening to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jay-zeezer.com/&quot;&gt;Weezer mash-up&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.broke-ass.com/black.html&quot;&gt;Metallica&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theslackalbum.com/djnwee/&quot;&gt;Pavement&lt;/a&gt; are downloading now.  The funny part is that I never cared all that much for the original Black album.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[Update]: the Metallica one is a horrible piece of garbage, the cadences of the songs barely match up.  I don&#x27;t understand why it keeps showing up on suprnova.  The Weezer one is decent, the cadences and moods of each song seem to mostly match up well.  The LO2 (Blackfish) is OK, it&#x27;s better than the Metallica one at least.  The Pavement one is probably my second favorite overall (to the Grey Album), it might be because I read the dude&#x27;s site who did it - he is a University Music Professor working on his PhD.","enclosures":[],"source":{"url":"","title":""},"changefreq":"never","priority":"0.1","bodyArticleHtml":"<hgroup><h3><time datetime=\"2004-04-26T11:15:00.000Z\" pubdate=\"pubdate\">2004-04-26</time></h3><h1><a href=\"http://travis.servebeer.com/posts/2004/04/26/jay-z-construction-set\">Jay-Z Construction Set</a></h1><h2></h2></hgroup>After <a href="http:<br>[Update]:theMetallicaoneisahorriblepieceofgarbage,thecadencesofthesongsbarelymatchup.Idon'tunderstandwhyitkeepsshowinguponsuprnova.TheWeezeroneisdecent,thecadencesandmoodsofeachsongseemtomostlymatchupwell.TheLO2(Blackfish)isOK,it'sbetterthantheMetallicaoneatleast.ThePavementoneisprobablymysecondfavoriteoverall(totheGreyAlbum),itmightbebecauseIreadthedude'ssitewhodidit-heisaUniversityMusicProfessorworkingonhisPhD.",	"bodyNavItems": [								{									"pageRel": "prev",								"href": "/posts/2004/04/27/do-you-like-spam-",				"text": "Doyoulikespam?"			}					, 			{									"pageRel": "prev",								"href": "/posts/2004/04/26/little-john-in-iraq",				"text": "LittleJohninIraq"			}					, 			{									"pageRel": "self",								"href": "/posts/2004/04/26/jay-z-construction-set",				"text": "Jay-ZConstructionSet"			}					, 			{									"pageRel": "next",								"href": "/posts/2004/04/23/spider-post-its",				"text": "SpiderPost-its"			}					, 			{								"href": "/posts/2004/04/23/favicon-generator",				"text": "FaviconGenerator"			}			]}
