I just found out yesterday that one of Sherry's good friend's husband was just killed over there not too long ago. I guess something went wrong when he was running a night convoy and his humvee hit a tank, rolled over 6 times, and he was killed. It makes me depressingly furious. I keep hoping there will be some kind of miracle and they will discover some WMD so that all these people won't have died in vain. Remember the good old days when we could make fun of our president for lying about an affair? or even "read my lips"? You can't really make too many jokes about going to war under false pretenses.</p></div></article></main><nav><h2>Other Stuff</h2><ul><li><a href="/posts/2004/09/24/moving">Moving</a></li><li><a href="/posts/2004/09/21/atari-announces-first-64-bit-game" rel="prev">Atari announces first 64-bit game</a></li><li><a href="/posts/2004/09/14/peace-has-been-restored-in-iraq-for-several-minutes-now" rel="self">Peace has been restored in Iraq (for several minutes now)</a></li><li><a href="/posts/2004/09/10/amd-inside" rel="next">AMD Inside?</a></li><li><a href="/posts/2004/09/09/gene-spafford-is-like-a-dr-phil-for-geeks">Gene Spafford is like a Dr. Phil for geeks...</a></li><li><a href="/posts" rel="archives ">Archive</a></li><li><a href="/about" rel="about ">About</a></li><li><a href="/tools">Tools</a></li><li><gcse:searchbox-only></gcse:searchbox-only></li></ul><h3>Folks</h3><ul><li><a href="http://ern.me/" rel="friend met co-worker colleague" title="Ern is my co-worker">Ern</a></li><li><a href="http://www.larryroth.net/" rel="friend met co-worker colleague" title="Larry is my boss">Larry</a></li><li><a href="http://ralphwhitbeck.com/" rel="friend met" title="Ralph is a former co-worker">Ralph</a></li><li><a href="http://sherrybdesign.com/" rel="friend met co-resident spouse sweetheart" title="Sherry is a Graphic Designer and my wife">Sherry</a></li></ul><h3>Work-related</h3><ul><li><a href="http://brandlogic.com/" title="Brandlogic is where I work">Brandlogic</a></li><li><a href="http://www.corebrand.com/" title="CoreBrand is a full service brand consultancy">CoreBrand</a></li><li><a href="http://www.tapdash.net/" title="TapDash, made by Brandlogic, is a real-time view of customer experience">TapDash</a></li></ul></nav><div id="comments"><a id="disqus_comments" href="/posts/2004/09/14/peace-has-been-restored-in-iraq-for-several-minutes-now#disqus_thread">Comments</a><div id="disqus_thread"></div><p><a href="//disqus.com" class="dsq-brlink">comments powered by <span class="logo-disqus">Disqus</span></a></p></div><footer><h2>© Travis Hardiman, et al. 1979-2079.</h2><p>All puns intentional even if stated otherwise, all posts are owned by their respective owners, any code posted is public domain unless stated otherwise</p></footer><div id="weather"></div><script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.0.min.js"></script><script src="/j/maina0z.js"></script></body></html>
