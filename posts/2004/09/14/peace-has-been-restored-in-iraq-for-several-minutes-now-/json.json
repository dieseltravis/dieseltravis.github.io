I just found out yesterday that one of Sherry&#x27;s good friend&#x27;s husband was just killed over there not too long ago. I guess something went wrong when he was running a night convoy and his humvee hit a tank, rolled over 6 times, and he was killed. It makes me depressingly furious.  I keep hoping there will be some kind of miracle and they will discover some WMD so that all these people won&#x27;t have died in vain.  Remember the good old days when we could make fun of our president for lying about an affair? or even &quot;read my lips&quot;?
