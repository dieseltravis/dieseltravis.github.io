Here&#x27;s a summary: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;A permanent, implantable contact lens that can dramatically improve vision in patients with severe nearsightedness is expected to receive FDA approval by the end of this year. [...] The lens was designed to remain in the eye permanently, but if a patients vision changes, the lens can either be removed and changed, or the patient can get regular corrective glasses, contact lenses or LASIK surgery.
