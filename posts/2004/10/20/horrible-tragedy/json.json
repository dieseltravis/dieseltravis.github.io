I tried to convince her that &lt;a href=&quot;http://pearpc.net/&quot; title=&quot;PearPC is pretty sweet IMO&quot;&gt;PearPC&lt;/a&gt; would be enough, but I guess it was just too slow on her junkware-laden pc (don&#x27;t get me started on that). Aside from the DVD drive (her PC only has a burner), the only differences hardware-wise are that the eMac&#x27;s processor is ~250MHz slower and it has half the RAM.  Oh yeah, and it was &lt;em&gt;twice&lt;/em&gt; the cost of what I paid for her PC... 2 years ago. All because her source files used fonts that she doesn&#x27;t have for her PC. *sigh* The PC can still be restarted twice in the time it takes for the eMac to boot up once.&lt;/p&gt;","enclosures":[],"source":{"url":"","title":""},"changefreq":"never","priority":"0.1","bodyArticleHtml":"<hgroup><h3><time datetime=\"2004-10-20T09:51:00.000Z\" pubdate=\"pubdate\">2004-10-20</time></h3><h1><a href=\"http://travis.servebeer.com/posts/2004/10/20/horrible-tragedy\">Horrible Tragedy</a></h1><h2></h2></hgroup><p><a href="http:</p>",	"bodyNavItems": [								{									"pageRel": "prev",								"href": "/posts/2004/10/21/charlie-and-the-chocolate-factory",				"text": "CharlieandtheChocolateFactory"			}					, 			{									"pageRel": "prev",								"href": "/posts/2004/10/20/monster-sunfish",				"text": "MonsterSunfish"			}					, 			{									"pageRel": "self",								"href": "/posts/2004/10/20/horrible-tragedy",				"text": "HorribleTragedy"			}					, 			{									"pageRel": "next",								"href": "/posts/2004/10/20/bear-powers",				"text": "BearPowers"			}					, 			{								"href": "/posts/2004/10/19/700-bear-vs-man-w-shotgun-result-draw",				"text": "700#Bearvs.Manw/shotgun-Result:draw"			}			]}
