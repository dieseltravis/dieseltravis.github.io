Apparently fall is the best time to plant shrubs as well so Sherry and I picked up a bunch.  I was reading the tags from one of the bushes I planted and it says: &quot;This plant is patented; vegetative propagation is prohibited.&quot;  The plant is a China Boy Holly (&lt;a href=&quot;http://woodyplants.nres.uiuc.edu/plant/ilemecb&quot;&gt;Ilex x meserveae &#x27;China Boy&#x27;&lt;/a&gt;), the reason I bought it was to pollinate the China Girl Holly we have.  Apparently &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.conard-pyle.com/&quot; title=&quot;JAVA applets for navigation roll-overs? are you serious?&quot;&gt;Conard-Pyle Company&lt;/a&gt; owns Plant Patent #4803 on this bad boy.  Since when have you been able to patent a living thing?  Well, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.biotech-info.net/upholds_right.html&quot; title=&quot;yay google!&quot;&gt;since 1985 (for plants)&lt;/a&gt;.  Apparently the only reason that plants are allowed to be patented is because companies have invested tons of money in creating these hybrids and they don&#x27;t want copycats to rip them off.  It just seems kinda bizarro to me.  I think I&#x27;m going to patent Sherry&#x27;s dog so that I can &lt;del&gt;sue everyone who owns a Brittany-spaniel-mutt&lt;/del&gt; - err I mean,  keep those copycats from stealing my ideas.  Here&#x27;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.organicconsumers.org/patent/plants062102.cfm&quot; title=&quot;I guess that patent thing was big news, too bad it was overshadowed by all those shark attacks in 2001.&quot;&gt;another article&lt;/a&gt;, lots of them in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?q=plant+patent&quot; title=&quot;plants patents&quot;&gt;google&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;","enclosures":[],"source":{"url":"","title":""},"changefreq":"never","priority":"0.1","bodyArticleHtml":"<hgroup><h3><time datetime=\"2004-10-11T18:41:00.000Z\" pubdate=\"pubdate\">2004-10-11</time></h3><h1><a href=\"http://travis.servebeer.com/posts/2004/10/11/china-boy-holly\">China Boy Holly</a></h1><h2></h2></hgroup><p><a href="http:</p>",	"bodyNavItems": [								{									"pageRel": "prev",								"href": "/posts/2004/10/18/pbs-frontline",				"text": "PBSFrontline"			}					, 			{									"pageRel": "prev",								"href": "/posts/2004/10/13/people-chips",				"text": "PeopleChips"			}					, 			{									"pageRel": "self",								"href": "/posts/2004/10/11/china-boy-holly",				"text": "ChinaBoyHolly"			}					, 			{									"pageRel": "next",								"href": "/posts/2004/10/11/ie-vs-fx",				"text": "IEvs.Fx"			}					, 			{								"href": "/posts/2004/10/07/hello-worldetc-again",				"text": "HelloWorld...Again"			}			]}
