No solution we are aware of comes close to the capabilities of the Xbox Media Center. Fortunately, the developers offer the XBMC free of charge and a suitably modded Xbox, such as the one we tested, with remote control and A/V cable, is readily affordable. [...] the inevitable onslaught of future systems that will support numerous multimedia file types will still have a tough time to beat the price/performance ratio a modded Xbox offers.&quot;  Really, &lt;a href=&quot;http://froogle.google.com/froogle?btnG=Froogle+Search&amp;q=xbox&quot;&gt;$150&lt;/a&gt; is a hell of a deal for something with this many features.  Why would anyone buy a PS2 or Gamecube when an Xbox has this much extensibility?  All Xbox needs to destroy the market is Gran Turismo and Mario.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xboxsolution.com/reviews-47.html&quot;&gt;It already has some sweet Atari games&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[Edit]: Premodded Xboxes from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.upgrade123.com/catalog/index.php?cPath=32&quot;&gt;FriendTech range in price from $199 - $479&lt;/a&gt;.","enclosures":[],"source":{"url":"","title":""},"changefreq":"never","priority":"0.1","bodyArticleHtml":"<hgroup><h3><time datetime=\"2004-05-11T10:09:00.000Z\" pubdate=\"pubdate\">2004-05-11</time></h3><h1><a href=\"http://travis.servebeer.com/posts/2004/05/11/mod-your-xbox-into-a-media-center-pc\">Mod your Xbox into a Media Center PC</a></h1><h2></h2></hgroup><a href="http:<br/>[Edit]:PremoddedXboxesfrom<ahref="http://www.upgrade123.com/catalog/index.php?cPath=32">FriendTechrangeinpricefrom$199-$479</a>.",	"bodyNavItems": [								{									"pageRel": "prev",								"href": "/posts/2004/05/12/you-re-the-man-now-dog-web-page-generator-forum-thingy",				"text": "&quot;you&#x27;rethemannowdog&quot;webpagegeneratorforumthingy"			}					, 			{									"pageRel": "prev",								"href": "/posts/2004/05/12/d00m",				"text": "D00M]|["			}					, 			{									"pageRel": "self",								"href": "/posts/2004/05/11/mod-your-xbox-into-a-media-center-pc",				"text": "ModyourXboxintoaMediaCenterPC"			}					, 			{									"pageRel": "next",								"href": "/posts/2004/05/10/no-kids-for-you",				"text": "NoKidsforYou!"			}					, 			{								"href": "/posts/2004/05/06/us-draft",				"text": "USDraft"			}			]}
