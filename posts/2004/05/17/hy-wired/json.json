It sounds really futurustic.  Has tons of sweet features and looks similar to the new Prius: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gm.com/company/gm_exp_live/events/paris_2002/gm/hywire/index.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://a1112.g.akamai.net/7/1112/492/2002091454/www.wired.com/news/images/full/x02cc_co150_f.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Too bad we won&#x27;t see them till around 2015 or so.  Which should give GM enough time to fix the glitches mentioned in the article.  &quot;&#x27;It&#x27;s for the PlayStation generation, when they grow up,&#x27; the rep told [the author]. [She] asked if they made an Atari version. Quite seriously, [she] was told that, yes, they could make one.&quot; Hopefully by then they&#x27;ll also make an AWD version for rugged folks like me.
