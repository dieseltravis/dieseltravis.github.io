For some reason I thought I might <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22tina+fey%22+scar">google to see how she got that scar on her face</a>. I visited the <a href="http://www.bondcliff.net/content.mv?file=tinafey">first result</a> and although it provides no useful (or truthful) info, it's pretty entertaining. Here's one user's comment:<br/><blockquote>4/4/2004 - 2:13<br/>[<a href="mailto:jpdedmon@hotmail.com">Salamander West</a>] <a href="http://www.clownpenis.fart">http://www.clownpenis.fart</a><br/>The real story behind Tina's scar:<br/>In 1975 Lil' Lizzy, as she was called then, lived in Northern Pennsylvania. She was a bright kid and her parents were very proud of her. She did however express a few oddities that concerned them. Tina loved ham. Not in the way that many people do; she loved to play with it. She especially enjoyed it when it was frozen. On the day of the tragic accident, Tina's father was driving home from work when he found his little ham-loving princess running through the street with a large frozen ham she had apparently stolen from a nearby supermarket. He called to her from his car but in all her excitement, Tina had covered her entire head in mud and cat hair, as she often did at that age. Her father, Don (a.k.a. 'The Jackhammer'), made a critical mistake. He was desperate to protect his little angel from her addiction to ham (in 1975 ham was considered a narcotic), so he chucked a handful of yogurt from a bucket he kept in the passenger seat of his car. Unfortunately, the yogurt wad caught the 70-pound 6-year-old square in the chest. Stunned and embarrassed, she ran toward the house screaming 'Melons!' Her Mother stepped out of their trailer and did not recognize Tina right away, but she did recognize the ham, for she too had her dark obsessions. Without thinking, she grabbed a sack full of wet puppies and swung it at the child, knocking her into a farmer with a lisp. The farmer pulled out a toenail clipper and swung wildly in self defense. His attack proved true as he was quite the martial artist in his youth, and Tina was badly scarred. Don the Jackhammer ate the ham and never told his wife.</blockquote></div></article></main><nav><h2>Other Stuff</h2><ul><li><a href="/posts/2004/05/03/bowgo">BowGo</a></li><li><a href="/posts/2004/05/03/jim-the-hammer-shapiro" rel="prev">Jim &quot;The Hammer&quot; Shapiro</a></li><li><a href="/posts/2004/05/02/tina-fey" rel="self">Tina Fey</a></li><li><a href="/posts/2004/04/30/how-to-turn-your-pc-into-a-moblog" rel="next">How to turn your PC into a moblog...</a></li><li><a href="/posts/2004/04/29/google-s-feeling-lucky">Google&#x27;s Feeling Lucky</a></li><li><a href="/posts" rel="archives ">Archive</a></li><li><a href="/about" rel="about ">About</a></li><li><a href="/tools">Tools</a></li><li><gcse:searchbox-only></gcse:searchbox-only></li></ul><h3>Folks</h3><ul><li><a href="http://ern.me/" rel="friend met co-worker colleague" title="Ern is my co-worker">Ern</a></li><li><a href="http://www.larryroth.net/" rel="friend met co-worker colleague" title="Larry is my boss">Larry</a></li><li><a href="http://ralphwhitbeck.com/" rel="friend met" title="Ralph is a former co-worker">Ralph</a></li><li><a href="http://sherrybdesign.com/" rel="friend met co-resident spouse sweetheart" title="Sherry is a Graphic Designer and my wife">Sherry</a></li></ul><h3>Work-related</h3><ul><li><a href="http://brandlogic.com/" title="Brandlogic is where I work">Brandlogic</a></li><li><a href="http://www.corebrand.com/" title="CoreBrand is a full service brand consultancy">CoreBrand</a></li><li><a href="http://www.tapdash.net/" title="TapDash, made by Brandlogic, is a real-time view of customer experience">TapDash</a></li></ul></nav><div id="comments"><a id="disqus_comments" href="/posts/2004/05/02/tina-fey#disqus_thread">Comments</a><div id="archived_comments"><h2>Archived Comments</h2><table><thead><tr><th>name</th><th>date</th><th>comment</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>john hardiman </td><td><time datetime="2004-05-03T22:04:00.000Z" pubdate="pubdate">2004-05-03 06:04</time></td><td>forget about all that......I heard she shows her tits in the movie. yes, or no??<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Enquiring New Mexican Minds Need to Know.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="http://travis.servebeer.com/blog.net/">travis </a></td><td><time datetime="2004-05-03T22:53:00.000Z" pubdate="pubdate">2004-05-03 06:53</time></td><td>Not according to these movie buffs:<br><a target="_new" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0275486/board/nest/8165847">http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0275486/board/nest/8165847</a></td></tr><tr><td>Dr. </td><td><time datetime="2004-06-04T18:00:00.000Z" pubdate="pubdate">2004-06-04 02:00</time></td><td>She got her scar from a rapist, post rape, to remind her to keep quiet about it.<br><br>That's why she's not talking about it.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="http://travis.servebeer.com/blog.net/">travis </a></td><td><time datetime="2004-06-04T18:12:00.000Z" pubdate="pubdate">2004-06-04 02:12</time></td><td>Dr. - ...and you know this to be true because...???</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div id="disqus_thread"></div><p><a href="//disqus.com" class="dsq-brlink">comments powered by <span class="logo-disqus">Disqus</span></a></p></div><footer><h2>© Travis Hardiman, et al. 1979-2079.</h2><p>All puns intentional even if stated otherwise, all posts are owned by their respective owners, any code posted is public domain unless stated otherwise</p></footer><div id="weather"></div><script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.0.min.js"></script><script src="/j/mainYBz.js"></script></body></html>
