I think that&#x27;s part of the reason that I like Allman-style block formatting my code more than standard &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style&quot;&gt;K&amp;amp;R style&lt;/a&gt;. It just looks balanced for some reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing that my family always teases me about is the set of rules that I have when I go out to eat at some place new or some place that I don&#x27;t go to often. In a party of 6 or less I don&#x27;t like to order the same thing as anyone else. In larger parties as long as I don&#x27;t order the same thing as the people next to me or across from me, it&#x27;s OK. I usually pick out what I&#x27;d like to order and 2 back-ups. If I order first and someone else orders the same thing, I won&#x27;t change my order, I&#x27;ll just be disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;","enclosures":[],"source":{"url":"","title":""},"changefreq":"never","priority":"0.1","bodyArticleHtml":"<hgroup><h3><time datetime=\"2007-10-10T11:59:00.000Z\" pubdate=\"pubdate\">2007-10-10</time></h3><h1><a href=\"http://dieseltravis.github.io/posts/2007/10/10/ocd\">OCD</a></h1><h2></h2></hgroup><p><a href="http:<p>ThecomickindastruckanervebecauseasidefromthefactthatIcleanmyglasseseverymorningandiftheyareeversmudged,I'vealwayslikedthingsthatweresymmetrical.Ithinkthat'spartofthereasonthatIlikeAllman-styleblockformattingmycodemorethanstandard<ahref="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style">K&amp;Rstyle</a>.Itjustlooksbalancedforsomereason.</p><p>OnethingthatmyfamilyalwaysteasesmeaboutisthesetofrulesthatIhavewhenIgoouttoeatatsomeplaceneworsomeplacethatIdon'tgotooften.Inapartyof6orlessIdon'tliketoorderthesamethingasanyoneelse.InlargerpartiesaslongasIdon'torderthesamethingasthepeoplenexttomeoracrossfromme,it'sOK.IusuallypickoutwhatI'dliketoorderand2back-ups.IfIorderfirstandsomeoneelseordersthesamething,Iwon'tchangemyorder,I'lljustbedisappointed.</p>",	"bodyNavItems": [								{								"href": "/posts/2007/11/04/beer-is-better-than-water",				"text": "BeerisBetterthanWater"			}					, 			{									"pageRel": "prev",								"href": "/posts/2007/10/25/i-ll-bet-there-were-four-of-them",				"text": "I&#x27;llbettherewerefourofthem..."			}					, 			{									"pageRel": "self",								"href": "/posts/2007/10/10/ocd",				"text": "OCD"			}					, 			{									"pageRel": "next",								"href": "/posts/2007/09/01/michael-jackson-dead",				"text": "MichaelJackson,Dead"			}					, 			{								"href": "/posts/2007/08/27/killface-2008",				"text": "Killface2008"			}			]}
