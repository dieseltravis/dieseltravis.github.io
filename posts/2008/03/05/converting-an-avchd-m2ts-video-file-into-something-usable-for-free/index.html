Unfortunately, it came with nothing that would transcode the video files into more commonly supported formats like MP4 (or AVI) so that they can be easily edited and/or uploaded to sites like <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/hd">Vimeo</a> (or Youtube or whatever). I tried a bunch of different apps (FFmpeg, Mencoder, Avidemux, MediaCoder all FAIL) but this process worked the best for me.</p><h2>Downloads</h2><p>Three basic things needed to download:</p><ol><li><a href="http://www.codecguide.com/download_mega.htm">K-Lite Mega Pack</a> - when installing, make sure that as many of the following plugins are checked as possible (it seems like they're often renamed or removed): AC3, AAC, M2TS, AVCHD, x.264, h264, MP4, M4A, Mpeg4, Haali. You may not need all of the Codecs in this install, but better safe than sorry</li><li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=57023&amp;package_id=72557&amp;release_id=366702">AviSynth</a> - download and install normally</li><li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=156112&amp;package_id=174059&amp;release_id=559463">MeGui</a> - after downloading and installing:<ul><li>go directly to Options - Update, after updating, go there again to be sure you got them all</li><li>I imported all profiles that it gave me the option to, but if you want to make it easy on yourself, you can import the settings that I use: <a href="http://travis.servebeer.com/megui-travis.zip">megui-travis.zip (3 KB)</a>, just go File - Import Profiles, and select the zip file with my settings</li><li>make sure in Options - Settings - Program Paths, that everything is correct, for me most apps were set to a subfolder of the MeGui install, but the AviSynth path had to be set to its own folder</li></ul></li></ol><h2>Config</h2><p>After opening my M2TS video file in MeGui, here's the settings that worked for me:</p><fieldset><legend>travis1.avs - AviSynth Script</legend><pre>DirectShowSource("T:\video\20080211\one.M2TS",fps=29.9700898503294,audio=false)
AssumeTFF().FieldDeinterlace()
LanczosResize(1280,720) # Lanczos (Sharp)</pre></fieldset><p>These might just be specific to the <strong>HG10</strong>, but its native video needed to be deinterlaced using the <strong>FieldDeinterlace</strong> and it was set to <strong>top field first</strong>, whatever that means, you can find those settings out by hitting the <strong>Analyze</strong> button if you don't have a HG10 (or if you just don't trust me). The frame rate was set to 30/1001(29.97)fps for NTSC, and here I am resizing it from 1440x1080 to <strong>1280x720</strong> for a Vimeo 16:9 HD upload. You'll probably want to set it to the native resolution if you plan on doing a bunch of crazy editing. Be sure to hit the <strong>Save</strong> button and rename it to something else.</p><p>Then the other video settings:</p><dl><dt>AviSynth Script (above, or whatever you saved your own settings as)</dt><dd>T:\video\travis1.avs</dd><dt>Video Output</dt><dd>T:\video\20080211\one-v.mp4</dd><dt>Video Profile</dt><dd>travis1</dd></dl><p>The <strong>travis1</strong> video profile sets the Codec to <strong>x264</strong>, format to <strong>MP4</strong>, and bitrate to <strong>5000</strong>, everything else I left at its defaults. If you make any changes, I'd recommend saving them to new profiles since it makes it so much easier to tweak the settings.</p><p>Here's the audio settings:</p><dl><dt>Audio Input (this is the same file as I selected in the File ? Open command above)</dt><dd>T:\video\20080211\one.M2TS</dd><dt>Audio Output</dt><dd>T:\video\20080211\one-a.mp4</dd><dt>Audio Profile</dt><dd>travis2</dd></dl><p>The Codec that worked for me is <strong>FAAC</strong> and extension is <strong>MP4-AAC</strong> with a <strong>128</strong> bitrate.</p><h2>Go!</h2><p>Now just hit the <strong>AutoEncode</strong> button. The only things I change on this screen is the filename, the Average bitrate (<strong>5000</strong> again), and then I just hit <strong>Queue</strong>.</p><p>Switch over to the Queue tab in MeGui's main window. Click on the <strong>New worker</strong> button in the lower right. (isn't this hard core? *wink*) Then highlight everything in the queue and send it to the worker you've created. This can be useful if you have a sweet multi-core machine and want to encode a bunch of different files at the same time. When you're ready to go, switch over to the worker window and hit <strong>Start</strong>.</p><p>Once your new <strong>MP4</strong> (or AVI or whatever you're exporting to) file is rendered then you can go nuts and edit it with whatever you want or just upload it.</p></div></article></main><nav><h2>Other Stuff</h2><ul><li><a href="/posts/2008/03/29/prk">PRK</a></li><li><a href="/posts/2008/03/14/hope-change" rel="prev">HOPE/CHANGE</a></li><li><a href="/posts/2008/03/05/converting-an-avchd-m2ts-video-file-into-something-usable-for-free" rel="self">Converting an AVCHD M2TS Video File Into Something Usable (for free!)</a></li><li><a href="/posts/2008/02/05/can-t-get-enough-travis" rel="next">Can&#x27;t get enough Travis?</a></li><li><a href="/posts/2008/01/10/e-lec-tri-city">E-lec-tri-city!</a></li><li><a href="/posts" rel="archives ">Archive</a></li><li><a href="/about" rel="about ">About</a></li><li><gcse:searchbox-only></gcse:searchbox-only></li></ul><h3>Folks</h3><ul><li><a href="http://ern.me/" rel="friend met co-worker colleague" title="Ern is my co-worker">Ern</a></li><li><a href="http://www.larryroth.net/" rel="friend met co-worker colleague" title="Larry is my boss">Larry</a></li><li><a href="http://ralphwhitbeck.com/" rel="friend met" title="Ralph is a former co-worker">Ralph</a></li><li><a href="http://sherrybdesign.com/" rel="friend met co-resident spouse sweetheart" title="Sherry is a Graphic Designer and my wife">Sherry</a></li></ul><h3>Work-related</h3><ul><li><a href="http://brandlogic.com/" title="Brandlogic is where I work">Brandlogic</a></li><li><a href="http://www.corebrand.com/" title="CoreBrand is a full service brand consultancy">CoreBrand</a></li><li><a href="http://www.tapdash.net/" title="TapDash, made by Brandlogic, is a real-time view of customer experience">TapDash</a></li></ul></nav><div id="comments"><a id="disqus_comments" href="/posts/2008/03/05/converting-an-avchd-m2ts-video-file-into-something-usable-for-free#disqus_thread">Comments</a><div id="archived_comments"><h2>Archived Comments</h2><table><thead><tr><th>name</th><th>date</th><th>comment</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href="http://www.nextfeature.com">Adam Lindsay </a></td><td><time datetime="2008-03-06T10:12:00.000Z" pubdate="pubdate">2008-03-06 05:12</time></td><td>Wow thats complex. For those on OS X, iMovie and Final Cut support AVCHD out of the box. :)</td></tr><tr><td><a href="http://travis.servebeer.com/blog.net/">Travis </a></td><td><time datetime="2008-03-06T12:07:00.000Z" pubdate="pubdate">2008-03-06 07:07</time></td><td>@Adam well, if you upgraded to iLife 2008 (*not free*) that is. iMovie 2006 doesn't support it (or at least doesn't support the M2TS versions). You're stuck in terminal if you want to try to do anything like this for *free* on OSX. Not necessarily a bad thing, but not as easy as this.<br/><br/>Anyways, I think you missed that *free* keyword. If you want to pay on Windows there are plenty of apps for you that support AVCHD and M2TS out of the box: Sony Vegas, Adobe Premiere &amp; After Effects, and Avid are the big ones. Vegas is actually ridiculously easy. But again, *not free*.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="http://www.myspace.com/silksmile">Cari </a></td><td><time datetime="2008-03-16T12:44:00.000Z" pubdate="pubdate">2008-03-16 08:44</time></td><td>Wow this does look complex. I'm going to try it though, because I want my videos on YouTube dammit! And I don't want to pay that much to make my own little creations. Vegas is $600+!

I can't guarantee I'll answer them, but I'll try.<br/><br/>Let me know if you had to do anything different too, I'm curious if there's an easier, or better way to export the movies. Especially if you had to change the settings to make the movie optimized for youtube. Thanks!</td></tr><tr><td>Julian </td><td><time datetime="2008-06-01T15:57:00.000Z" pubdate="pubdate">2008-06-01 11:57</time></td><td>Please help me, error fatal importing my m2ts file.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="http://travis.servebeer.com/blog.net/">travis </a></td><td><time datetime="2008-06-01T19:00:00.000Z" pubdate="pubdate">2008-06-01 03:00</time></td><td>@Julian: MeGui gives you a fatal error?

It uses M2TS file format. There was a CD that came with the camera with the Picture Motion Browser software. Once you import the vidoe from the camera with the Picture Motion Browser, right click on the video clip. Select "convert to MPEG-2 and save" or "convert to WMV and save". Then you can manipulate the video with virtually any editing software. I use Adobe Premiere Elements. It can handle 1080i resolution but my question is, does converting to .mpg affect the video quality?</td></tr><tr><td>Brian </td><td><time datetime="2009-03-24T13:05:00.000Z" pubdate="pubdate">2009-03-24 09:05</time></td><td>Adam,<br/><br/>I have the exact same camera. The corel software does in fact have a built in conversion option. You open the clip, select it, and hit "export selected clip". At the next screen hit "custom" or whatever and there you can select what format you want to export the file into.<br/><br/>:)</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div id="disqus_thread"></div><p><a href="//disqus.com" class="dsq-brlink">comments powered by <span class="logo-disqus">Disqus</span></a></p></div><footer><h2>Â© Travis Hardiman, et al. 1979-2079.</h2><p>All puns intentional even if stated otherwise, all posts are owned by their respective owners, any code posted is public domain unless stated otherwise</p></footer><div id="weather"></div><script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.0.min.js"></script><script src="/j/mainUNq.js"></script></body></html>
