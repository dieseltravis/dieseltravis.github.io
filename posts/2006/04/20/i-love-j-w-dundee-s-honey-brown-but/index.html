Honey Brown is usually pretty cheap compared to my other favorites, and I probably would've bought it without the rebate, but knowing that I'd save an extra dollar made me feel a little better.</p><p>A few weeks later I filled out the rebate form and started realizing that the rebate form only had the PO Box, and no City, State, and Zip code. I found <a href="mailto:consumeraffairs@genbrew.com">two ways</a> to contact <a href="https://www.highfalls.com/default.html">High Falls Brewery</a> through their terrible flash site and sent messages to both. I got the following response from them on March 17th: <strong>the day that the rebate was supposed to be postmarked by</strong>:</p><blockquote><p>Good morning,</p><p>We apologize for any inconvenience that this mix up may have caused. We would like to thank you for bringing this to our attention since the rebate forms were printed by a separate company and thank you for your interest in Honey Brown. The complete address is listed below. Please feel free to contact us if you have any further inquiries.</p><pre>
HONEY BROWN VALENTINE REBATE
P.O. BOX 4412
YOUNG AMERICA, MN 55558-4412
</pre><p>Thank you,</p><p>Consumer Affairs<br/>High Falls Brewing Company<br/>445 St. Paul Street<br/>Rochester, NY 14605<br/>consumeraffairs@genbrew.com<br/>(585) 263.9446</p></blockquote><p>I rushed home for lunch (after all this was for a whole dollar, or $0.61 after postage), and mailed out the rebate. Then in early April the letter with the enclosed rebate was returned with this message on it:</p><blockquote><pre>NIXIE	553	1	06	03/30/06
RETURN TO SENDER
NOT DELIVERABLE AS ADDRESSED
UNABLE TO FORWARD
BC:	(my zip+4)35	*1913-14629-17-35</pre></blockquote><p>Of course all of this had to happen when I had been working over 10 hours a day 7 days a week for pretty much all of March. Needless to say my blood pressure was high enough without some BS like this. Now I know it was only $1, but it's the principle of the whole thing. I almost felt like sending it to <a href="http://www.oag.state.ny.us/" title="every consumer's hero">Eliot</a>, I think I <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient-ff&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=GGGL,GGGL:2006-10,GGGL:en&amp;q=%22Eliot+Spitzer+is+*%22" title="suing?">have an idea</a> of what would happen, and after all the lawyers got paid, I don't think I'd see my dollar. I've contacted High Falls since then but they've not even bothered responding to my emails, let alone try to rectify their mistake. (how about a $1 off coupon, jerks?) Maybe <a href="http://www.consumerist.com" title="Travis &lt;3's The Consumerist">The Consumerist</a> will save the day? Anyone else get suckered in by this one?</p></div></article></main><nav><h2>Other Stuff</h2><ul><li><a href="/posts/2006/05/25/cyber-nations">Cyber Nations</a></li><li><a href="/posts/2006/04/22/what-the-bleep-do-we-know" rel="prev">What The Bleep Do We Know!?</a></li><li><a href="/posts/2006/04/20/i-love-j-w-dundee-s-honey-brown-but" rel="self">I love J.W.
