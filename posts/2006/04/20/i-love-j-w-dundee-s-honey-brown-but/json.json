Honey Brown is usually pretty cheap compared to my other favorites, and I probably would&#x27;ve bought it without the rebate, but knowing that I&#x27;d save an extra dollar made me feel a little better. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few weeks later I filled out the rebate form and started realizing that the rebate form only had the PO Box, and no City, State, and Zip code. I found &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:consumeraffairs@genbrew.com&quot;&gt;two ways&lt;/a&gt; to contact &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.highfalls.com/default.html&quot;&gt;High Falls Brewery&lt;/a&gt; through their terrible flash site and sent messages to both. I got the following response from them on March 17th: &lt;strong&gt;the day that the rebate was supposed to be postmarked by&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good morning,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We apologize for any inconvenience that this mix up may have caused.  We would like to thank you for bringing this to our attention since the rebate forms were printed by a separate company and thank you for your interest in Honey Brown.  The complete address is listed below.  Please feel free to contact us if you have any further inquiries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;HONEY BROWN VALENTINE REBATEP.O. BOX 4412YOUNG AMERICA, MN 55558-4412&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumer Affairs&lt;br /&gt;High Falls Brewing Company&lt;br /&gt;445 St. Paul Street&lt;br /&gt;Rochester, NY 14605&lt;br /&gt;consumeraffairs@genbrew.com&lt;br /&gt;(585) 263.9446&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I rushed home for lunch (after all this was for a whole dollar, or $0.61 after postage), and mailed out the rebate. Then in early April the letter with the enclosed rebate was returned with this message on it:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;NIXIE	553	1	06	03/30/06RETURN TO SENDERNOT DELIVERABLE AS ADDRESSEDUNABLE TO FORWARDBC:	(my zip+4)35	*1913-14629-17-35&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course all of this had to happen when I had been working over 10 hours a day 7 days a week for pretty much all of March. Needless to say my blood pressure was high enough without some BS like this. Now I know it was only $1, but it&#x27;s the principle of the whole thing. I almost felt like sending it to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oag.state.ny.us/&quot; title=&quot;every consumer&#x27;s hero&quot;&gt;Eliot&lt;/a&gt;, I think I &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient-ff&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;rls=GGGL,GGGL:2006-10,GGGL:en&amp;amp;q=%22Eliot+Spitzer+is+*%22&quot; title=&quot;suing?&quot;&gt;have an idea&lt;/a&gt; of what would happen, and after all the lawyers got paid, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d see my dollar. I&#x27;ve contacted High Falls since then but they&#x27;ve not even bothered responding to my emails, let alone try to rectify their mistake. (how about a $1 off coupon, jerks?) Maybe &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.consumerist.com&quot; title=&quot;Travis &amp;lt;3&#x27;s The Consumerist&quot;&gt;The Consumerist&lt;/a&gt; will save the day?
