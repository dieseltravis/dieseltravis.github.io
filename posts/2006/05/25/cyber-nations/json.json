Like he says it&#x27;s just as addicting as Real Thugz was, but there is much, much less time required. I only have to login once or twice a day to check up on it. The integration with google maps is kinda sweet. And it&#x27;s interesting the roles that religion, government type, and resources have in the game. It was definitely well thought out and it looks like it is constantly being tweaked as well, so that&#x27;s kinda sweet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My nation is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cybernations.net/nation_drill_display.asp?Nation_ID=16391&quot;&gt;Super Happy Fun Land&lt;/a&gt;, my citizens don&#x27;t seem to agree though. Those losers better shut up and get back to work, they&#x27;ll pay their taxes and they&#x27;ll like it. ;-) (Go Green Team!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Update: I just realized that all of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cybernations.net/&quot;&gt;Cyber Nations&lt;/a&gt; website doesn&#x27;t have a single banner - not even &lt;a href=&quot;http://s15.invisionfree.com/Cyber_Nations/index.php?act=idx&quot;&gt;the forums&lt;/a&gt; - that&#x27;s amazing.&lt;/p&gt;","enclosures":[],"source":{"url":"","title":""},"changefreq":"never","priority":"0.1","bodyArticleHtml":"<hgroup><h3><time datetime=\"2006-05-25T18:58:00.000Z\" pubdate=\"pubdate\">2006-05-25</time></h3><h1><a href=\"http://travis.servebeer.com/posts/2006/05/25/cyber-nations\">Cyber Nations</a></h1><h2></h2></hgroup><p><a href="http:</p><p>Mynationis<ahref="http://www.cybernations.net/nation_drill_display.asp?Nation_ID=16391">SuperHappyFunLand</a>,mycitizensdon'tseemtoagreethough.Thoselosersbettershutupandgetbacktowork,they'llpaytheirtaxesandthey'lllikeit.;-)(GoGreenTeam!)</p><p>Update:Ijustrealizedthatallof<ahref="http://www.cybernations.net/">CyberNations</a>websitedoesn'thaveasinglebanner-noteven<ahref="http://s15.invisionfree.com/Cyber_Nations/index.php?act=idx">theforums</a>-that'samazing.</p>",	"bodyNavItems": [								{									"pageRel": "prev",								"href": "/posts/2006/06/22/would-the-robot-be-up-for-a-threesome-with-the-tivo-",				"text": "WouldtherobotbeupforathreesomewiththeTiVo?"			}					, 			{									"pageRel": "prev",								"href": "/posts/2006/05/30/that-s-it-i-ve-had-it-with-these-motherfucking-snakes-on-this-motherfucking-plane-",				"text": "That&#x27;sIT!I&#x27;vehaditwiththesemotherfuckingsnakesonthismotherfuckingplane!"			}					, 			{									"pageRel": "self",								"href": "/posts/2006/05/25/cyber-nations",				"text": "CyberNations"			}					, 			{									"pageRel": "next",								"href": "/posts/2006/04/22/what-the-bleep-do-we-know-",				"text": "WhatTheBleepDoWeKnow!?"			}					, 			{								"href": "/posts/2006/04/20/i-love-j-w-dundee-s-honey-brown-butetc",				"text": "IloveJ.W.Dundee&#x27;sHoneyBrown,but..."			}			]}
